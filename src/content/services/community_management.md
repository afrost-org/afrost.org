FOSS communities are formed by loosely bound individuals  who come from various fields and are in different stages of there lives.

The one goal which binds these communities together is the passion for learning , As these Communities  grow slowly they spread there cause be it a Technology or Cultural one  and  soon they become so big that they need help in managing there small events to big annual gatherings , this is where we  help them

We are the face of the community who needs help in representing them in the physical world
  We work along with Community volunteers to work with Corporate Sponsors 
Spreading word about there event in our Network of  curated  Developer communities
