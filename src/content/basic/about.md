AFROST ( Association for Promotion of Free and Open-Source Technologies) was born with a vision to support and sustain the Free and Open Source Software communities and their culture.

We are a group of technology enthusiasts who have benefited and grown as leaders by living and learning in FOSS communities. AFROST strives to give back by helping to sustain and support in growing these communities.

Our mission is to create Indiaâ€™s future Open Source leaders by nurturing talent through mentorship, building communities by supporting them with resources, and forging partnerships with industry, policy makers, and  stakeholders in the Ecosystem.
